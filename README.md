# Product-Comparison-Calculator

The Price Comparison Calculator is a Python-based project developed during the first-year semester 1 as part of coursework or individual project assignment. The primary goal of this application is to facilitate users in comparing prices of products across different platforms or stores. It aims to provide a simple yet effective tool for consumers to make informed purchasing decisions by easily identifying the best deals available.

Features:

1. **User-Friendly Interface**: The project will have a straightforward user interface designed for ease of use, ensuring accessibility for users with varying levels of technical proficiency.

2. **Product Input**: Users can input details of the product they wish to compare. This may include the product name, brand, model, and other relevant information.

3. **Price Comparison Algorithm**: The heart of the project will be an algorithm designed to compare and analyze prices obtained from different stores. This algorithm will process the collected data and display a clear comparison of prices, highlighting the best deals and savings for the user.

4. **Display Results**: The results will be presented to the user in a concise and understandable format.

5. **Customization and Sorting**: Users might have the option to customize the comparison parameters or sort the results based on price or quality.

7. **Error Handling**: Robust error handling mechanisms will be implemented to manage scenarios like unavailable data.

8. **Documentation and Comments**: Clear and comprehensive documentation along with inline comments in the code will be provided to facilitate understanding and maintenance of the project.

Skills Acquired:

Developing this Price Comparison Calculator project in Python during the first semester equips me with fundamental programming concepts such as:

- Data input and validation
- Algorithm design and implementation for data analysis
- User interface design and user experience considerations
- Error handling and debugging in Python
- Documentation and commenting for code readability and maintenance

This project provided an excellent opportunity for me to apply my programming skills in a practical scenario, emphasizing the importance of data manipulation and presentation in real-world applications.
